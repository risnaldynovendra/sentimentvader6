Clearly, it is an attempt to intimidate people so that they do not stand for their constitutional rights.

Despite the bail of Dr Shireen Mazari and Senator Fulk Naz Chitrali by the Islamabad High Court, they were abducted from inside Adiala Jail and shifted to the Secretariat where Dr. Shirin Mazari heard the sound of the shouting.

The brutal treatment of our female workers, whose video evidence is also constantly emerging is very hated.

Many of our female members of the National Assembly, workers and supporters are being trapped in prisons across the country in very unlawful conditions, where they are under police abuse.

The abduction and treatment of these female citizens by this feminist government is not only a serious violation of human rights but also against our culture and Islamic teachings.
